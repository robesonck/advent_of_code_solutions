# Advent of code solutions

Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge

## Usage

Every exercise is done like a test file, the way to start a new exercise is:

1. Duplicate the file [template.test.ts](https://github.com/robesonck/advent_of_code_solutions/blob/main/template.test.ts) and use it as a template
2. Easily to test by running `npm run test:watch {path_to_test}.test.ts`

```
In the future this might change to have a more structured way.
```
